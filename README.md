Project Title: Queue Simulation Case Study using SimPy

Description:
This simulation models a queueing system (a cashier counter) to analyze system performance under different scenarios â€” Base Case, More Cashiers, Peak Time, and Peak + More Cashiers. It measures metrics such as average waiting time, queue length, utilization, throughput, and percentage of customers served.

I have done this for my performance modelling Case study.


## Features

The program will display the event log (customer arrivals, service times) and summary tables in the terminal.

Observe performance metrics for each scenario and compare results in the summary table.

Output:

1.   Console output includes event logs 
2.   Summary experiment tables with 
      Average Wait Time
      Average Queue Length
      Throughput
      Utilization
      % of Customers Served

3.   Gives visual charts like:
      Average Wait Time per scenerio 
      Average Queue Length per scenerio
      Throughput per scenerio
      Utilization per scenerio
      Service efficiency per scenerio


## Installation

1.  Requirements
Make sure Python 3.13.1 is installed on your system. You can download it from python.org

2.  Dependencies
Libraries: simpy, random, statistics

You can install dependencies by running the following command in your terminal or command prompt:
pip install simpy

Clone the repository to your local machine:
git clone https://github.com/2001zaz/EEX5362_fastfoodqueue_simulation.git

Open the Python file in VS Code or any Python IDE to run the simulation.
