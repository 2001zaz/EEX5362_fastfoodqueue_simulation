# Fastfood_queue_simulator Python

Project Title: Queue Simulation Case Study using SimPy

Description:
This simulation models a queueing system (a cashier counter) to analyze system performance under different scenarios â€” Base Case, More Cashiers, Peak Time, and Peak + More Cashiers. It measures metrics such as average waiting time, queue length, utilization, throughput, and percentage of customers served.

I have done this for my performance modelling Case study.



## Features


The program will display the event log (customer arrivals, service times) and summary tables in the terminal.

Observe performance metrics for each scenario and compare results in the summary table.

Output:

Console output includes event logs and summary tables like:

Average Wait Time

Average Queue Length

Throughput

Utilization

% of Customers Served
